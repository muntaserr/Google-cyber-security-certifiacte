# Security Risk Assessment Report

| **Part** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement** | |
| **Three hardening tools the organization can use to address the vulnerabilities found include:** | |
| 1. **Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | MFA requires users to use more than one way to identify and verify their credentials before accessing an application. Some MFA methods include fingerprint scans, ID cards, pin numbers, and passwords. |
| 2. **Setting and Enforcing Strong Password Policies** | Password policies can be refined to include rules regarding password length, a list of acceptable characters, and a disclaimer to discourage password sharing. They can also include rules surrounding unsuccessful login attempts, such as the user losing access to the network after five unsuccessful attempts. |
| 3. **Performing Firewall Maintenance Regularly** | Firewall maintenance entails checking and updating security configurations regularly to stay ahead of potential threats. |

| **Part 2: Explain your recommendation(s)** | |
|------------------------------------------| |
| **Enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | MFA will reduce the likelihood that a malicious actor can access a network through a brute force or related attack. It will also make it more difficult for people within the organization to share passwords. Identifying and verifying credentials is especially critical among employees with administrator-level privileges on the network. MFA should be enforced regularly. |
| **Creating and Enforcing a Password Policy** | A password policy within the company will make it increasingly challenging for malicious actors to access the network. The rules included in the password policy will need to be enforced regularly within the organization to help increase user security. |
| **Regular Firewall Maintenance** | Firewall maintenance should happen regularly. Firewall rules should be updated whenever a security event occurs, especially an event that allows suspicious network traffic into the network. This measure can protect against various DoS and DDoS attacks. |
