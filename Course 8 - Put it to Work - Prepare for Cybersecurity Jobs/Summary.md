## **Feedback on Course Content**

### **Module Feedback**
- This module was a **short recap** of previous content with vague references to **security mindset**.  
- Some of the feedback felt **overly enthusiastic**, such as:  
  - *"I hope you enjoyed our discussion as much as I did!"*

---

### **Incident Stakeholders Module Feedback**
- Good **balance between Google products** (e.g., Google Sheets) and other tools like **Apache OpenOffice**.  
- However, this module felt **basic and generic**—more like office skills training.
- If someone is learning **Python, Linux, and SQL**, they can figure out how to use **Google Sheets** without detailed instruction.

---

### **General Course Feedback**
- The **slow speaking pace** was frustrating, making it feel like there were **technical playback issues**.  
- **1.5x speed** became necessary for all content to sound normal, as **anything under 1.25x felt unnatural**.  
- While intended to aid non-native English speakers, the **playback speed options and subtitles** should suffice without slowing the pace.

---

## **Career Module Feedback**

- The course drifted into **generic career advice**, such as:
  - How to write resumes and cover letters.
  - How to create an elevator pitch and use job sites.
  - How to build rapport in interviews.

- The career advice felt **detached from the main course topics** (e.g., Python, Linux, cybersecurity).  
- Link to **Interview Warmup Tool by Google**:

### **Final Thoughts**

- The **instructors congratulating students at the end** was a nice touch. It was fun to see familiar faces from earlier modules—*a pleasant surprise*.
- However, the **last module’s content felt disconnected** from the technical skills built throughout the course.
