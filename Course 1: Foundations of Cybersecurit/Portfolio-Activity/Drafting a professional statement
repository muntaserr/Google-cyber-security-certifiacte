Hello, I am Almuntaser Ghassan Al Maawali, a passionate cybersecurity professional and computer science graduate from Dalhousie University.
With a deep interest in network security, risk management, and incident response,
I specialize in safeguarding digital assets by identifying vulnerabilities, mitigating risks, and strengthening defenses.

Throughout my journey, I have worked hands-on with cybersecurity tools like Wireshark, Splunk, and SIEM platforms,
and I’m proficient in programming languages such as Python, C, and Java. My internship at Ahli Bank allowed me to apply
these skills in real-world scenarios by conducting risk assessments,
security event management, and policy implementations.

I believe in continuous learning and professional growth, 
evidenced by my achievements as a Sexton Scholar and multiple appearances on the Dean’s List. Additionally,
I have honed my skills through practical experiences with penetration testing, network analysis, and incident management.

I am driven by core values of integrity, diligence, and privacy protection.
I aim to leverage these values and skills to help organizations detect, manage, and prevent threats in an increasingly complex threat 
landscape. You’ll find several of my projects on GitHub, demonstrating my expertise in automation scripts, network analysis tools,
and cybersecurity algorithms.

I look forward to collaborating with like-minded professionals and contributing to open-source security projects.
Let’s connect to build a more resilient and secure digital future together.
