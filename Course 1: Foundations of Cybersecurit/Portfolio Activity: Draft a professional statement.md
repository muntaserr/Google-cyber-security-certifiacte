### Step 3: Draft your professional statement

Your professional statement is your opportunity to show prospective employers who you are as a person and potential employee, and it allows them to understand the value you can bring to the organization.

Follow these guidelines:

Open a word processing document or use a piece of paper to create your draft. 

1. Use this time to self-reflect and analyze why you want to pursue a career in cybersecurity.

- What interests you most about a career in cybersecurity?	

- What do you want to learn more about in the field of cybersecurity?

- What do you hope to achieve as a cybersecurity analyst?

2. Select two of your strengths. These can be strengths you currently have or ones that you are learning about and plan to develop throughout the program (e.g., collaboration, problem-solving, communication, using SIEM and other tools to identify and mitigate threats, risks, vulnerabilities, etc.) 

3. Select two of your values. Examples might include upholding an individual’s right to privacy and a commitment to helping organizations ensure confidential data is safe.

4. Create a core statement that represents your purpose or intention. In this case, your purpose or intention is to briefly explain or summarize your strengths and values in one to two sentences.

5. Explain how your chosen strengths and values help you accomplish your core statement.

### Step 4: Refine your professional statement
