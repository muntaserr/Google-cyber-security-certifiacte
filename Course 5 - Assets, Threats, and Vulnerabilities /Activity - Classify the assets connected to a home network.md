# Home Office Network Asset Inventory Activity

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will classify assets connected to a home office network. Asset management is a critical part of every organization’s security plan. Effective asset management starts with creating an asset inventory of assets that need protection and classifying them based on their importance and sensitivity to risk. 

### **Scenario**
You are operating a small business from home. Your home office includes devices such as a desktop computer, printer, router, webcam, speakers, headphones, and an external hard drive. Your task is to create an inventory of your network devices, assess their characteristics, and classify them based on their sensitivity to risks.

## **Instructions**

1. **Identify assets**:  
   - List three devices connected to your home network that are **not already in the template**. 
   - Example devices: desktops, smartphones, game consoles, storage devices, smart home devices, etc.

2. **Fill in characteristics**:  
   - **Network access**: How often is the device connected?
   - **Owner**: Who is responsible for the device?
   - **Location**: Where is the device located?

3. **Evaluate network access**:  
   - Add 1–2 notes on the purpose and security of each device.
   - Think about:  
     - What kind of information is stored?
     - Is the device carefully secured?

4. **Classify sensitivity**:  
   - Choose one of these classifications:
     - **Confidential**: Strictly limited access.
     - **Restricted**: Sensitive data, limited to specific users.
     - **Internal-only**: Accessible to internal users only.
     - **Public**: Open to anyone.

## **Explanation of Solution**

1. **Desktop Computer**:  
   - **Access**: Occasionally connected.  
   - **Owner**: Homeowner.  
   - **Location**: On-premises.  
   - **Notes**: Stores personal data that must be protected. Classified as **Restricted** since only the homeowner needs access.

2. **Network Router**:  
   - **Access**: Continuously connected.  
   - **Owner**: ISP.  
   - **Location**: On-premises.  
   - **Notes**: Uses 5 GHz for home devices. Classified as **Confidential** since it controls network access.

3. **Guest Smartphone**:  
   - **Access**: Occasionally connected.  
   - **Owner**: Friend.  
   - **Location**: On and off-premises.  
   - **Notes**: Temporary access to the network. Classified as **Internal-only** to limit access.

4. **External Hard Drive**:  
   - **Access**: Occasionally connected.  
   - **Owner**: Homeowner.  
   - **Location**: On-premises.  
   - **Notes**: Stores non-sensitive data (movies, music). Classified as **Confidential** since it shouldn’t be accessed publicly.

5. **Streaming Media Player**:  
   - **Access**: Continuously connected.  
   - **Owner**: Homeowner.  
   - **Location**: On-premises.  
   - **Notes**: Stores payment card information. Classified as **Internal-only** to prevent misuse.

6. **Game Console**:  
   - **Access**: Occasionally connected.  
   - **Owner**: Friend.  
   - **Location**: On and off-premises.  
   - **Notes**: Includes a camera and microphone. Classified as **Internal-only** to limit data exposure.

## **Conclusion**

This asset inventory demonstrates the importance of tracking network-connected devices and classifying them by sensitivity. Sensitive devices like the **router** and **desktop computer** require stricter controls to ensure security. This inventory process also shows how devices with occasional access (e.g., guest smartphones) should have limited permissions to protect the network from risks.

## **Key Takeaways**

- **Asset classification** helps prioritize which devices need stronger security.  
- **Evaluating ownership and network access** ensures better accountability and risk mitigation.  
- **Sensitivity levels** guide security controls, limiting potential breaches and misuse.  
- Creating an **asset inventory** is essential for home and business networks, demonstrating your **security awareness** to potential employers.
