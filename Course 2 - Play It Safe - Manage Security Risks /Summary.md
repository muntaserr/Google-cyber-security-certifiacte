# Cybersecurity Overview - Summary Notes

## CISSP's 8 Security Domains

1. **Security Goals and Risk Management**
   - Defining security goals and objectives.
   - Risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.

2. **Asset Security**
   - Securing digital and physical assets.
   - Managing storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.
   - Implementing policies and procedures for the above.

3. **Security Architecture and Engineering**
   - Ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes to protect assets and data.
   - Promoting shared responsibility across the organization.

4. **Communication and Network Security**
   - Managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.

5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
   - Identification, authentication, authorization, and accountability.

6. **Security Assessment and Testing**
   - Security control testing, audits, and data analysis.

7. **Security Operations**
   - Investigations and preventive measures.

8. **Software Development Security**
   - Following secure coding practices.

## Risk Overview

- **Risk:** Anything that impacts confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
- **Vulnerability:** A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.
  
### Risk Levels:
- **Low-risk asset:** Minimal harm to reputation or operations if compromised.
- **Medium-risk asset:** May affect reputation, operations, or finances.
- **High-risk asset:** Protected by laws (e.g., IP, PII, SPII).

## Layers of the Web

- **Surface Web:** Publicly accessible data.
- **Deep Web:** Unindexed content (e.g., intranet, login-restricted areas).
- **Dark Web:** Hidden services accessible via Tor.

## NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

1. **Prepare:** Monitor for risks and identify mitigation methods.
2. **Categorize:** Define processes and tasks for managing risks.
3. **Select:** Choose protective controls, develop playbooks.
4. **Implement:** Put selected controls into practice.
5. **Assess:** Ensure controls are working correctly.
6. **Authorize:** Create reports and action plans.
7. **Monitor:** Continuously observe and maintain controls.

## OWASP Overview

- **OWASP Top 10**: Tracks the most critical web security risks.  
  Visit: [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

### OWASP Principles:
- Minimize attack surface area.
- Follow the principle of least privilege.
- Implement defense in depth.
- Ensure separation of duties.
- Keep security simple.
- Set secure defaults.
- Donâ€™t trust external services.
- Avoid security by obscurity.

## Security Controls Overview

- **Encryption:** Converts data into ciphertext.
- **Authentication:** Verifies identity (e.g., login).
- **Authorization:** Grants specific users access.

### Control Types:
- **Physical:** Fences, CCTV, access badges.
- **Technical:** Firewalls, antivirus, multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Administrative:** Policies and authorizations.

---

## Security Audits

### Internal Audit Process:
1. Establish audit scope and goals.
2. Conduct a risk assessment.
3. Perform a controls assessment.
4. Assess compliance with regulations.
5. Communicate findings and recommendations.

## Common Types of Logs

- **Firewall Log:** Records incoming/outgoing network requests.
- **Network Log:** Tracks device connections.
- **Server Log:** Logs actions by services and users.

---

## SIEM Tools

- **Functionality:** Collects and analyzes log data.
- **Dashboards:** Visualizes security posture, incident reviews, and risk analyses.
  
### SIEM Hosting Options:
- **Self-hosted:** Fully controlled by the organization.
- **Cloud-hosted:** Managed by a cloud provider.
- **Hybrid:** Mix of self-hosted and cloud-hosted services.

### Example SIEM Tools:
- **Splunk:** Offers both enterprise and cloud versions.
- **Google Chronicle:** A cloud-native SIEM.

## Incident Response Playbooks

1. **Preparation:** Document procedures, assign responsibilities, educate staff.
2. **Detection and Analysis:** Identify and categorize incidents.
3. **Containment:** Prevent further damage and reduce impact.
4. **Eradication and Recovery:** Remove threats and restore operations.
5. **Post-Incident Activity:** Document actions, share insights, and apply lessons.
6. **Coordination:** Maintain communication throughout the response process.

## Security Frameworks

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

1. **Identify:** Monitor systems and identify risks.
2. **Protect:** Mitigate threats using tools, policies, and training.
3. **Detect:** Improve monitoring to catch incidents early.
4. **Respond:** Handle incidents effectively and document them.
5. **Recover:** Restore services and prevent recurrence.
